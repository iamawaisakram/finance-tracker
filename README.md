This is Rails app for finance(stock) tracking.

- Authenticate System, users can sign up, edit their profile, log in/out (used Devise)

- Users can track stocks, upto 10 per user, this profile page will display all the current stock prices

- Users can search for stock symbols using search bar

- Users can choose to add a stock from results of search to their portfolio

- Users can look for friends, or other users of the app, by name or email(first, last, email)

- Users can view the portfolio of stocks their friends are tracking for investing ideas

- Must be mobile friendly, so the styling has to be responsive that's why I used Bootstrap twitter theme.
